# Settings
A software-defined radio is used for monitoring the signal in the air. All nodes are connected to a router over Wi-Fi to monitor their states.
5 nodes (based on SX1280).

# MATLAB GUI and signals over-the-air:
The nodes configure their slots by themselves and synchronize with each other in a distributed manner. The signals over the air are captured by ADALM PLUTO SDR.
